# üéµ Music Recommendation System üéµ

Welcome to the **Music Recommendation System**! This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to recommend music tracks based on user preferences. Whether you‚Äôre into rock, pop, or classical, this system uses **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Collaborative Filtering** to help you discover new songs you‚Äôll love.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multiple Algorithms:** Utilizes Logistic Regression (both from scikit-learn and implemented from scratch), Random Forest, and Collaborative Filtering.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Provides music suggestions tailored to user preferences.
- **Scalable:** Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Flexible:** Easily extendable to include additional algorithms or datasets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get started with the Music Recommendation System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohamed682004/CodeAlpha_MUSIC-RECOMMDATION-SYSTEM.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd CodeAlpha_MUSIC-RECOMMDATION-SYSTEM
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

All the recommendation algorithms are implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook. Here‚Äôs how to use it:

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Music_Recommendation_System.ipynb
   ```
2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Execute each cell in the notebook to load the dataset, train the models, and generate recommendations.
   - The notebook includes the following algorithms:
     - **Logistic Regression (scikit-learn)**
     - **Logistic Regression (from scratch)**
     - **Random Forest**
     - **Collaborative Filtering (TensorFlow)**
3. **Explore the Results:**
   - After running the notebook, you‚Äôll see the recommendations generated by each algorithm based on the user‚Äôs preferences.

## üß† Algorithms and Technologies Used

- **Logistic Regression:** Implemented both using scikit-learn and from scratch.
- **Random Forest:** For ensemble-based recommendations.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Using TensorFlow for user-item interaction-based recommendations.
- **Python:** The core programming language used for development.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- **TensorFlow:** For building the Collaborative Filtering model.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and visualization.
